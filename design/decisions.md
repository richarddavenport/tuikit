# Decisions

Newest last. A decision is here when it closed off an alternative someone would
otherwise reach for.

## 1. The framework is a library and a scaffolder, split on mechanism vs policy

Four tools — swarmctl, pgctl, azctl, dugo — already share a shape, and it travels
by copy. A fix to a pane lands in one repo.

**Mechanism goes in the library.** `guard.Tokens`, `guard.Glyphs`, `theme`,
`docgen` are functions. They know Go source, terminal columns and ANSI, and they
know nothing about Postgres or Docker Swarm. They do not run anywhere; the tool
calls them.

**Policy goes in the scaffolder.** `tuikit new` will write the tool a test that
calls the guards and a workflow that runs it. That is an opinion about setup,
delivered as generated code the tool owns and can edit on day one.

**Backend-shaped things belong to the tool** — its fixtures, whether it captures
live frames at all, what has to be standing up for that. No answer tuikit could
give would be right for pgctl (needs a database), swarmctl (needs a swarm) and a
backendless tool at once.

The corollary: tuikit's CI tests tuikit. A consuming tool's CI is that tool's
business.

## 2. Roles are a closed struct with an escape hatch, not a map

`theme.Palette` has nine named fields, so a tool takes `theme.Default` and
overrides what it wants. A map of names would make every lookup a question of
whether the key exists.

`Extra` exists because the alternative is worse. A tool that needs a tenth
meaning and cannot name it reaches for `lipgloss.Color("39")` instead — and
`guard.Tokens`, the thing that keeps colours honest, is the first casualty. It
should still feel like a decision: a shade of an existing role is not one.

`Roles()` returns the nine in a fixed reading order with `Extra` appended, and
the `Why` text describes the role rather than the hue, so it survives a tool
recolouring the palette. That is the whole reason roles are named.

## 3. ANSI 256 indices, never truecolour hex

Inherited from swarmctl. A truecolour hex looks right on the machine it was
picked on and wrong over ssh from another; the 256 palette is what every terminal
has agreed on. `theme.Hex` converts for anything drawing outside a terminal, and
is computed from the palette formula rather than tabled — a table of nine
hand-copied values is nine chances to copy one wrong, and wrong here means a
design system quietly describing a different tool.

Capture will force lipgloss's *TrueColor profile* so those values are not
stripped when there is no TTY. That is not a contradiction: the values stay 256.

## 4. A GlyphSet is copied on extension, never mutated

`GlyphSet` is a map, and a map is a reference. A tool adding a glyph to
`DefaultGlyphs` in place would add it to every other tool in the process — and to
the guard that is supposed to catch it. `With` returns a copy, and panics on a
malformed call because that is a typo at the call site rather than a condition to
handle.

## 5. The guards take an interface, not `*testing.T`

`guard.T` is `Helper`/`Errorf`/`Fatalf`. `*testing.T` satisfies it, and so does a
recorder — which is what lets tuikit test that the guards actually fire. A guard
that never fires is indistinguishable from a clean package, and "the rule is
enforced" is exactly the claim worth checking.

For the same reason a guard pointed at a directory with no Go files calls
`Fatalf` rather than passing. Scanning nothing silently is how everyone comes to
believe a rule is on when it is not.

## 6. The guards parse, they do not match

A regex over source cannot tell a string literal from a comment that quotes one,
so a comment *explaining* a glyph got reported as printing it. `go/parser` hands
back only the literals. The test for this is kept as its own case, because the
bug is easy to reintroduce by "simplifying" the guard.

Role usage is matched on a selector — `\.Accent\b` — rather than a literal
`theme.` prefix. A tool may alias the import or hold a palette value of its own;
what is constant is that a role is reached through a dot.

## 7. The design system is generated, never maintained beside the code

A design tool draws pixels; a TUI draws a character grid. A mockup made without
the column budget, the 256 colours and the glyph allow-list is a picture of a
tool that cannot be built. So `docgen` renders from `theme`, and a test fails if
any terminal block in the bundle draws a character outside the set.

Only the foundations exist so far — colours, glyphs, the grid. Component and
screen cards arrive with the components. A card depicting a component that does
not exist is exactly the drift this package prevents.

`docgen` draws every role in a line of interface, generated from the palette
rather than written out, so an `Extra` role appears without editing the page and
a role cannot satisfy the guard with a swatch alone.

## 8. The name is tuikit, not ctlkit

`ctlkit` echoed the family it came from — swarmctl, pgctl, azctl — but the `-ctl`
suffix is a claim about what a tool *does*: it controls something. The framework
controls nothing. What it is about is the terminal interface, which is what the
four have in common and the only thing this module knows how to help with.

Renamed before anything imported it, which is the only cheap time to do it.
